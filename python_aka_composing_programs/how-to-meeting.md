### Pre-Meeting

- Read all assigned material, taking notes as needed
- Work through as many problems as possible
- Create example problems to demonstrate certain principles

### Meeting (start)

- Make sure everyone has Python installed
	- Walk them through installing or point them to the right resources
- Give a broad overview of the material we'll cover
- Ask if there are specific problems people had
- Things that are brief, address immediately, take note of the other ones and address them at the end
- Review each section and encourage discussion
	- The main point here is encouraging an active discussion
	- Your job is to _facilitate_ and keep the topic dedicated to the subject at hand

### After 20-25 Minutes...

- Take a 5 minute break.
- People can walk away from the computer, or stay and chit-chat
- Before beginning again, ask if anyone has questions
- Again, address things that can be done quickly, save more complex things for later

### Meeting (-end)

- Summarize the topics
- Show some code examples and encourage others to share their work
- Tie in any themes from the learning unit to the larger section
- Address any leftover questions, encourage participation

### Post-meeting

- Try to end on time.
- Write a summary/blog (can be brief) or what we talked about and who was there
- Pick a couple of things that you learned and mention those
	- Take particular note of _how_ and _what_ you may have been confused about
	- ... and what wording or examples help to get clarity
- Tell everyone THANK YOU for participating!
